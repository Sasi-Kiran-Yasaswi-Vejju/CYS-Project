# Secure Document Management System (CYS Lab Project)

This project is developed as part of the **Cyber Security Lab Evaluation**.  
It demonstrates the **practical implementation of cyber security concepts** using a **React frontend** and a **Node.js + MongoDB backend**.

---

## 🔐 Project Objective

To design and implement a **secure document management system** that ensures:

- Confidentiality of data  
- Integrity of documents  
- Secure user authentication and authorization  

The project applies **cryptographic and security mechanisms** in a real-world web application.

---

## 🛡️ Security Concepts Implemented

- **AES-256 Encryption**
  - Encrypts document content before storage.
- **SHA-256 Digital Hashing**
  - Ensures document integrity via digital signatures.
- **Base64 Encoding**
  - Safe representation of encrypted data.
- **JWT Authentication**
  - Secure login and protected API routes.
- **Middleware-based Authorization**
  - Prevents unauthorized access.
